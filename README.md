# Generative-Gear
A JavaFx program I am writing from scratch and all assets were created by me. The goal of this program is to generate a unique looking piece of gear, whether it be a sword, axe, pickaxe, etc., and give them stats based on a few factors.

The piece of gear is determined by a set amount of parts to make it
  Ex. Swords having 5 parts: Pommel, Handle, Guard, Blade Body, and Blade Tip
Each part has a material attached to it, which will determine its base stats, and modifiers to those base stats. Some of the stats being durability, weight, length, and attack damage. More are planed as more gear types are added, but for right now those are the ones in place.
